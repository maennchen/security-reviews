# Security

**Do not disclose "new" or "unknown" vulnerabilities to this project or to this repository about other projects.**

So, if you find a vulnerability (or evidence of one)
in a specific project other than this one,
and that vulnerability is not already well-known
publicly, please report the vulnerability to *that* project.

If you find a vulnerability (or evidence of one)
in this specific project (e.g,. its scripts), please *do* report such
vulnerabilities to us.

We prefer that you use the [GitHub mechanism for privately reporting a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Under the
[main repository's security tab](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/security), in the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click
Advisories, then click "Report a vulnerability" to open the advisory form.
